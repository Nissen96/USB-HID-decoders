The challenge started by writing out a fake flag.
Then it wrote the real contents of the flag, one character at a time on top of each other.

This is where the animation functionality is very helpful.
Run the mouse decoder with e.g. --speed 2.
Then note down characters during the animation, pressing SPACE to pause/resume.
When the view is too cluttered after a few characters, press C to clear.
